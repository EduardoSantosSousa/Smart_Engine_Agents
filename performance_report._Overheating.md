### 2025-03-01 13:30:39 - Corrective Action
- **Action:** `"maintain_boost"`
- **Reason:** "The engine is currently in high demand mode with a target performance of 150%. The current RPM and load are within safe limits. However, the oil pressure is below the minimum safe level and the engine is at risk of mechanical wear. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain the boost while performing maintenance to address the low oil pressure and prevent further mechanical wear. This includes checking the gaskets and seals for wear and deformation, inspecting the oil filtration system, and applying anti-wear coatings if necessary. Predictive monitoring should also be implemented to detect any changes in vibration, temperature, and pressure in real time."

## Performance Analysis by the Expert
Executive Summary:
The engine is currently in a high demand mode with an operating hour of 136. The cooling efficiency is at 79.6%, oil viscosity is at 0.84, and injector health is at 73.2%. The engine has undergone 24 interventions. 

Main Risks Identified:
1. The engine is in "maintain_boost" mode, which requires careful maintenance of the turbocharger lubrication system.
2. The cooling efficiency is below optimal, which could lead to overheating.
3. The oil viscosity is slightly high, which could increase internal friction and raise engine temperature.
4. The injector health is below optimal, which could lead to injection system failures.

Recommended Action Plan:
1. Replace worn or cracked oil lines, seals, and gaskets around the turbocharger lubrication system.
2. Ensure that the turbocharger oil return lines are free of blockages or restrictions.
3. Check coolant levels and inspect heat exchangers for scale, corrosion, or blockages.
4. Clean and inspect radiators and intercoolers for debris, corrosion, or obstructions in airflow.
5. Check the viscosity and quality of the lubricating oil as per the manufacturer’s recommendations.
6. Monitor oil pressure and check for possible leaks in the system.
7. Inspect the fuel filter, injector, and fuel pump.
8. Conduct tests according to ISO 8217:2017 for fuel quality and check fuel lines.

Prioritized List of Issues and Corrective Actions:
1. Maintain the turbocharger lubrication system.
2. Improve the cooling efficiency.
3. Maintain the oil viscosity.
4. Improve the injector health.

Efficiency Insights and Operational Optimization Suggestions:
1. Ensure adequate airflow to engine components.
2. Implement redundant cooling systems.
3. Install sensors to monitor coolant temperature, pressure, flow rate, and oil temperature.
4. Establish a preventive maintenance program that includes regular inspection of cooling system components, engine parameters, and sensor calibrations.
5. Use oils certified according to the API CI-4 standard to improve thermal resistance.
6. Inspect cooling system pumps to ensure they are operating at the correct pressure.
7. Inspect water jacket cooling circuits for blockages and optimize coolant flow.
8. Use test benches to verify spray angle and measure average droplet size.
9. Use a mechanical stethoscope to detect cavitation.
10. Use IoT sensors for moisture and injection pressure.
11. Verify gas purity and supply pressure for dual-fuel engines.
